<h1>What is PNNL style?</h1>
<p>PNNL style refers to the citation format of references in your document and your document's bibliography. This style is based on a style amenable to a research laboratory and compatible with PNNL's internal information database, reference management software tools, and nationally accepted standards.</p>
<p>Guidelines for using the PNNL style can be found in the PNNL's <a href="https://ag.pnl.gov/refs.stm">Author's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, standards for dataset citation have not been approved by any governing bodies. Until then, current style guides can be used to craft an adequate citation.</p>
<p>PNNL style follows the Chicago Manual of Style. A suitable format for citing a dataset would be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Author. Year submitted. <em>Title of dataset</em>. Version. Geographical place of production: Name of producing organization. [Distributed by] Location of distributor: Name of distributor. DOI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>McGrail P. 2013. <em>R245fa Adsorption on MIL-101</em>. Richland, WA: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. doi: 10.15121/1148803</p>
  <p>In this example, the producer and distributor are the same.</p>
