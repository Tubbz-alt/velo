<h1>What  is meant by &ldquo;data that validates results&rdquo;?</h1>
<p>Here is the Department of  Energy&rsquo;s glossary description of &ldquo;Validate&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the context of this statement, <em>validate</em> means to support, corroborate,  verify, or otherwise determine the legitimacy of the research findings.  Validation of research findings could be accomplished by reproducing the  original experiment or analyses; comparing and contrasting the results against  those of a new experiment or analyses; or by some other means.&rdquo; (<a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Validate">http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Validate</a>) </p>
