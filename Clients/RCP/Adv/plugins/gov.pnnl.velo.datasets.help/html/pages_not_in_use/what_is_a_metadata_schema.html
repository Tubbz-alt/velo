<h1>What is a metadata schema? </h1>
<p>A schema (also called a  metadata standard or metadata schema), in terms of metadata, is a defined structure of metadata  elements organized in a way that is accepted by a specific community. When data  follows a schema, it is easier to exchange between two entities in the  community because a common interpretation of the data is understood. As an  example, if you have three data points, X, Y, and Z, each point is understood  to be a piece of metadata, and their relationship and meaning to each other is  the schema.</p>
