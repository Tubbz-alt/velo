<h1>Are there embargo periods already defined in DOE funding agency requirements?</h1>
<p>Yes, in some. Check your Funding Opportunity Announcement  or sponsoring entity for details.</p>
<p><em>Example: </em>From  the DOE Biological and Environmental Research â€“ Climate and Environmental  Sciences Division: &ldquo;The exclusive use period for additional research data is  defined to be one year after the end of the data acquisition period for the  proposed performance period of the award but exceptions to extend this period  may be justified for unique or extenuating circumstances.&rdquo;
