<h1>What is an embargo period?</h1>
<p>An embargo period is a  period of time where data is allowed to not be released to the public-at-large.  It gives the researcher the opportunity to analyze the data and produce  publications before making the data public. There is not a standard embargo  period accepted among all funding agencies, so check the requirements for your  sponsor.</p>
