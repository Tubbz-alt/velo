<h2>Publish</h2>
<p>Now that you've uploaded your data, described it, and made it through review, you are prepared to publish it. Publishing your data means that it will receive a DOI and a landing page that is accessible to the public. If you received a draft DOI earlier, it will change to a permanent DOI and your landing page will reflect the information for the public to download your dataset.</p>
<p>This is a good time to review your data management plan for any details about access to your data. Familiarize yourself with any future actions you may need to attend to such as removing the data after a period of time, or procedures for handling requests for access-restricted data. </p>
