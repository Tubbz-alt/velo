<h2>Information for OSTI</h2>
<p>&quot;Announcement Notice (AN) 241.6 provides to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office     of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) metadata needed to identify/announce     publicly available datasets resulting from work funded by the U.S. Department of Energy     (DOE) or performed in DOE facilities.  The information allows OSTI to assign Digital Object     Identifiers (DOI) to datasets and register them with <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> as a service to researchers.     This value-added step facilitates visibility, helps ensure long-term preservation, and     supports better linkage between DOE's published research results and the underlying data.     See <a href="https://www.osti.gov/elink/aboutDataIDService.jsp">About OSTI's Data ID Service</a> for information about the process     by which a DOI is assigned to a dataset and the benefits that result.&quot; (<a href="https://www.osti.gov/elink/F2416instruct.jsp?printerfriendly=true#purpose">OSTI</a>)</p>
<p>Velo was designed so information you provide about your dataset would be automatically uploaded to OSTI. Some metadata elements are the same between Project Open Data and OSTI. To prevent you from having to enter the data twice, Velo understands which elements are the same and will transmit those using the information you entered in the stage <a href="info_about_your_dataset.html">Information About Your Dataset</a>. The list below shows those elements that are not similar and need your information. Each element is hyperlinked to a page with more details and examples.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that though your dataset(s) are not being housed on OSTI resources, information about the datasets produced from DOE-sponsored research and development must be provided to OSTI.</p>
