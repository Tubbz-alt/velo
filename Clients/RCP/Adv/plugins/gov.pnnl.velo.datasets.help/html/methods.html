<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Methods is about describing how the data was derived. If it was derived from the field, you may want to describe the sensor array and transmission of data to where you harvest it. If the data is from laboratory experiments, you may want to describe the experimental procedures, equipment, and conditions. For simulated data, you may want to describe the simulation, hardware involved, and code used. A methods document should be uploaded to Velo to fulfill this field.</p>
