<h2>Add Images, Video, and Links</h2>
<p>You can add images, video, or URLs that help provide further information about your dataset.</p>
<p>The image gallery allows a Velo user to upload images from their dataset. Including images on the landing page can provide a visual description of your data and highlight the important findings in any papers that used your dataset. </p>
<p>The video viewer allows a Velo user to upload one video from their dataset. This feature is useful to show simulations or videos of subatomic phenomena.</p>
<p>URLs that you add here should relate to webpages associated with your dataset. An example would be the homepage for the project your dataset contributes to. For links to publications where the dataset was used, please see <a href="publications.html">Publications</a>.</p>
