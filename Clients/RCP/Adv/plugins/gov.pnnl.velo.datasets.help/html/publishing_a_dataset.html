<h1>Publishing a Dataset</h1>
<p>Velo  provides a data publication service where datasets are published with a unique  Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and registered with DataCite. This data  publication service helps ensure long-term preservation,  and supports better linkage between DOE&rsquo;s published  research results and the underlying data. The DOI for all registered datasets  provide access to an introductory page (landing page) as well as the dataset  and any related publications (access permitting). Existing Velo users will have  full access to the published data, as well as tools to interact with the data  and supplementary information such as presentation, white papers and  publications.</p>
<p>There are several steps to publishing a dataset.</p>
<table width="657" border="0">

    <td width="458" height="96"><p><strong>Prepare your dataset. </strong>If you have been working in Velo, all of the data you need will be ready for publishing. Refering to your project's data management plan will help you gather additional information. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="117"><p><strong>Describe your data. </strong>Metadata will be added to provide information about your dataset on the landing page, and to satisfy the requirements for receiving a digital object identifier (DOI). Adding this information also provides better ability to find your dataset in search engines.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="47"><p><strong>Upload data. </strong>You will upload your files so they can be reviewed and assigned a DOI.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="113"><p><strong>Get a draft DOI. </strong>This is an optional step. If you are not ready to publish your data, but you need a DOI to use in a publication, then you are allowed to receive a draft DOI from the Office of Science and Technical Information (OSTI).</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="91"><p><strong>Data review. </strong>If your dataset needs to be reviewed by a Authorized Derivative Classifier and/or checked for intellectual property, this is the stage at which that is performed.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Publish. </strong>When your dataset has been reviewed and approved for publishing, you will receieve a final DOI and a landing page (if one has not already been granted).</td>
