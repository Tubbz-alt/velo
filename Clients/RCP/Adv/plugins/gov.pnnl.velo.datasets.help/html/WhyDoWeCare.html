<h1>Why do we care about dataset management?</h1>
<p><strong>Data management</strong> is the process of controlling the   information generated during a research project at all stages of the data lifecycle, including capture, analysis, sharing and preservation. Funding agencies are    requiring scientists to plan and execute good data management   practices.Managing data became  an integral part of the research process and public access to research federally funded is now a priority.</p>


<p>On 28 July 2014, the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science announced new requirements for the management of digital research data. The new requirement outlined in a <a href="http://aas.org/files/resources/doesc_sddm_dehmersigned_28jul2014.pdf">Dear Colleague letter</a> from Patricia Dehmer, acting director of   DOE's Office of Science, are in response to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf">White House Office of   Science and Technology Policy directive</a>.</p>
<p>Since October 1, 2014, all proposals submitted to the Office of Science for research funding   are now required to include a data management plan (DMP) that describes   whether and how the digital research data generated through the course   of the proposed research will be <strong>shared</strong> and <strong>preserved</strong>. </p>
