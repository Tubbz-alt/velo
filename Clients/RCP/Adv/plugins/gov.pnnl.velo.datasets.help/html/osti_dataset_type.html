<h1>OSTI Metadata</h1>
<h2>Dataset Type</h2>
<p><strong>This is a required field.</strong> Select one choice from the drop-down list that best describes the dataset's main content.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Animations/Simulations - Animations and simulations resulting from runs of computer models or similar software.</li>
  <li>Figures/Plots - A dataset consisting mainly of data diagrams, graphs and charts, diagrams or schematic drawings. </li>
  <li>Genome/Genetics Data - Information that is numeric or   alpha-numeric in nature (such as gene sequences) or that is a   specialized mix of text and non-text information conveying results of   genetics/genome research</li>
  <li>Interactive Data Map(s) - A non-static interface and the GIS data and/or shape files that generate it. </li>
  <li>Multimedia - An example of a multimedia dataset might be a   video of an experiment in progress, where the camera monitors change   over a number of hours. </li>
  <li>Numeric Data - Data primarily expressed with numbers; other content is secondary and supporting. </li>
  <li>Specialized Mix - This &quot;type&quot; may be used to indicate a   dataset made up of content that doesn't fit into one of the other &quot;type&quot;   categories.  The content of a &quot;specialized mix&quot; dataset could have some   of everything in this list, for example, but is clearly focused on data   and does not have a &quot;format&quot;, such as a technical report that is   focused on data would </li>
  <li>Still Images or Photos - A collection of images or   photographs that are produced by a scientific instrument or that convey   scientific results of experiments.  Scientific images that might   constitute a data set could be images of cells or molecules that are   typically taken with electron microscopes, 3-D structures of proteins or   nanomaterials, images captured during an accelerator run, images from   astronomy, etc.</li>
</ul>
