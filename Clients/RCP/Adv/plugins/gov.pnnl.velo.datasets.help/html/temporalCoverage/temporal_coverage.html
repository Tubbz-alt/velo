<h2>Temporal Coverage</h2>
<p>The range of temporal applicability of a dataset (i.e., a  start and end date of applicability for the data).</p>
Dates should be formatted as pairs of {start  datetime/end datetime} in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO  8601</a> format. ISO 8601 specifies that datetimes can be formatted in a number  of ways, including a simple four-digit year (eg. 2013) to a much more specific YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, where the T specifies a separator  between the date and time and time is expressed in 24 hour notation in the UTC  (Zulu) time zone. Use a forward slash (&ldquo;/&rdquo;) to separate start and end times.
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<p>Applicability starting in July 2015 and continuing for one month would look like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2015-07/P1M</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
  <li>2015-07/2015-08</li>
</ul>
If there is a need to define the start or end of  applicability using a duration rather than a date, ISO 8601 formatting can  account for this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals">with  duration based intervals</a>.
