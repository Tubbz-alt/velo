<h2>Update Frequency</h2>
<p>(Optional field) The frequency that your resource is  updated. The format for the repeating duration must follow ISO 8601 unless the frequency  is irregular, in which case the value should simply be irregular.</p>
<p>The value should not include a start or end date, but rather  express the duration of time between data publishing. For example, a dataset  which is published on an annual basis would be R/P1Y; every three months would be R/P3M; weekly would be R/P1W; and daily would be R/P1D.</p>
