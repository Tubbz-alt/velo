<h2>Title</h2>
<p><strong>This is a required field.</strong> This field is for a human-readable name or title by which  the resource is known. Enter the title exactly as given on the product itself, including part, version, and similar information. It should include sufficient detail to facilitate search  and discovery. Write-out all acronyms not standard to the expected audience.</p>
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;GSNI  Tellus Urban Deep Soils â€“ Trace Element Analysis by ICP-OES and ICP-MS.&rdquo; <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/gsni-tellus-urban-deep-soils-trace-element-analysis-by-icp-oes-and-icp-ms-following-near-total">link</a></p>
<p>Audiences in chemistry-related fields will  understand the shorthand ICP-OES and ICP-MS. However, they may not know what  GSNI is, so that is an acronym that you may want to write-out. In this title,  GSNI is the &ldquo;Global Survey of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
