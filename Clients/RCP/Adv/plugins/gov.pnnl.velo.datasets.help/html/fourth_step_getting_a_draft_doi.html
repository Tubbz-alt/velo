<h2>Get a Draft DOI</h2>
<p><strong>This step is optional.</strong></p>
<p>When the situation arises where you will be publishing a paper before the dataset is published, you will need a draft digital object identifier (DOI) to use in your paper to cite your dataset. The Department of Energy Office of Science and Technical Information (OSTI) allows you to receive a draft DOI.</p>
<p>All that is required to receive a draft DOI is a landing page for the dataset. Velo was developed so that a user can provide all of the information needed to create the landing page <em>and</em> make the DOI request to OSTI.</p>
<p>After your data has undergone appropriate reviews (step five), you will be presented with the mechanics to publish your dataset and make your draft DOI permanent (step six).</p>
