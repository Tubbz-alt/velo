<h1>Which data should I share and preserve?</h1>


<p align="left">It is the  Principal Investigator's (PI) responsibility to determine which data should be the subject of the Data Management Plan (DMP), and to propose which data should be shared and preserved.  The following has to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what types of data the proposed research will generate</li>
  <li>which data could have value to others </li>
  <li>when will the data be shared</li>
  <li>are any limits to data sharing required (e.g., intellectual property protection)</li>
  <li>what data formats and quality standards will be applied to enable the data to be shared effectively.</li>
</ul>

      <p align="left">The Office of Science provides the following definition for <em>Data Sharing</em> :</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;<em>Data Sharing means making data available to people other than   those who have generated them. Examples of data sharing range from   bilateral communications with colleagues, to providing free,   unrestricted access to the public through, for example, a web-based   platform.&quot;</em></p>      <p align="left"><strong>Data Preservation </strong></p>
    <p align="left"><em>Data preservation</em> means providing for the usability of data beyond the lifetime of the research activity that generated them.</p></td>
