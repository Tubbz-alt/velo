<h2>Upload Data: Selecting what data to upload</h2>
<p>Your research may have produced a lot of data, but not all of it may be necessary to include in your uploaded dataset. Refer to your project's Data Management Plan for guidance about what data to upload. Also, this <a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#AdditionalGuidance">guidance</a> from the Department of Energy is provided when developing the data management plan:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Principal Investigator  should determine which data should be the subject of the [data management plan]  and, in the [data management plan], propose which data should be shared and/or  preserved in accordance with the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Requirements">Requirements</a>.&quot; (continues)  &quot;In determining which data should be&nbsp;<a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Sharing">shared</a> and <a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Preservation">preserved</a>, researchers  must consider the data needed to <a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Validate">validate</a> research  findings as described in the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/digital-data-management/#Requirements">Requirements</a>, and are  encouraged to consider the potential benefits of their data to their own fields  of research, fields other than their own, and society at large.&quot;</p>
