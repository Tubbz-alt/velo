Steps to create a new web service in Alfresco:

1) Fix the CAT Server Build/local-build.properties file to use local values

2) Make a wsdl file.  Either copy one of the alfresco wsdls and edit accordingly
   (which is easier if you are using mostly the same objects), or make a new wsdl.

	TODO: do we need a nice wsdl editor?
	TODO: if we decide to make wsdl from scratch, is wsdl2java ant task worth it?
	
3) Generate server side code.
	a) Create a new ant task to generate your code (copy "gen-user-service-server" task
	   and modify accordingly)
	b) Add your task to the "gen-all-service-servers" depends list
	c) Run your task
	
4) Modify the server-config.wsdd file to add your new web service
	a) Copy <service name="UserService"...> element (at the bottom of the file) and paste after closing </service> tag
	b) On the pasted <service> delete everything below <!-- generated below here -->  to the end of the </service> tag
	c) Copy everything inside the <service> tag in your deploy.wsdd file in your service's 
	   generated directory and past it below the <!-- generated below here -->  line in 
	   server-config.wsdd
    d) modify everything above the <!-- generated below here --> comment to match your new wsdl
	
5) Add your service bean declaration(s) to source/config/web-services-application-context.xml.  
   Make sure if you copy an Alfresco service that uses a query cache, that you create your own 
   cache bean.
	
6) Edit your web service implementation code to work with the generated code.

7) Generate client side code
	a) create ant task in CAT Client Web Service project
	   (copy "gen-user-service-client" task and modify accordingly)
	b) Add your task to the "gen-all-service-client" depends list
	
8) Edit AlfrescoWebServiceFactory to add your new web service.
	
9) Deploy your server files to TOMCAT and your client files to CAT
   a) Run CAT Server Build/build.xml deploy target (if starting from scratch)
   b) Run CAT Server Build/build.xml deploy-incremental target (if you only
      made a few code changes - this will not start from clean build)
