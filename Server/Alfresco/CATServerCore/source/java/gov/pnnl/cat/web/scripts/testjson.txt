  "description": "The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus)[2][4] is a small, usually
 furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. They are often called housecats when kept as indoor pets
 or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are
 often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin.\n\nCats are similar in anatomy
 to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth
 adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can
 hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
 small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision
 and a better sense of smell than humans.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species
 and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing
, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[7]\n\nCats
 have a high breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree
 pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering and the abandonment
 of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population
 control.[8] This has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to extinction of
 many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within a specific region and may
 have contributed to extinction of isolated island populations.[9] Cats are thought to be primarily,
 though not solely, responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral
 and free ranging cats makes some locations unsuitable for attempted species reestablishment in otherwise
 suitable locations.[10]",
